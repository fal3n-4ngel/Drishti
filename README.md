Drishti is a simple mobile application created as a project for YIP KDISC and Google Devs Solution Challenge.
This app aims to make reporting and spreading the news of accidents and dangers easier and effective. 


 
## The Problem
  One of main reason of accidents and deaths caused by snapped power lines and broken pipelines is ts the lack of a way to effectively inform the locality about this incident, many walk into these traps withot knowing.

## The solution
  Drishti offers a simple and easy platform to report and get alerts on events on our locality.It will also redirect the cases of snapped lines and cables to respective authorities.
